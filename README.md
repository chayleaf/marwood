Marwood is a [Scheme R5RS](https://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/) implementation for rust, featuring:

* a scheme r5rs compiler & 64 bit virtual machine composed of 3x64bit cells
* mark & sweep garbage collection
* a terminal based repl using [rustyline](https://github.com/kkawakam/rustyline)
* a WASM target repl using [xterm-js-rs](https://github.com/segeljakt/xterm-js-rs) auto deployed to [github pages](https://strtok.github.io/marwood/)

# Design

## VCells

Marwood's virtual machine is composed of 24 byte (3x64 bit) [VCells](marwood/src/vm/vcell.rs)
represented by rust enums. The VCell type is universal and used to represent values
in the various Marwood regions (stack, heap, bytecode, global and local environment).

These cells are used to represent:

* Primitive scheme types
  - Fixednums
  - Bools
  - Pairs
  - Strings
  - Symbols
* Instruction op codes
* Instruction operands
* Heap and environment pointers

## Heap

Marwood's [heap](marwood/src/vm/heap.rs) is composed of a growbable vector of VCell
slots. [Garbage collection](marwood/src/vm/gc.rs) is performed via a root based
mark & sweep.

## Global Environment

Marwood maintains a global [environment](marwood/src/vm/environment.rs), which may
be manipulated by the scheme `define` procedure. This environment represents a global
mapping of symbol => heap reference for the compiler, which in turn emits O(1) shallow
bindings (environment slot references) for the runtime.

### Procedure Application

Consider the following definition and application of add:
```scheme
  (define add (lambda (x y) (+ x y)))
  (add 10 20)
```
Marwood's compiler will emit instructions to evaluate each operand and 
push its result on the stack left to right, push %ep and then %ip, resulting 
in the following CALL setup and stack.

The result of a procedure application in Marwood is always stored in %acc.

```
    MOV      $05        %acc       //10
    PUSH     %acc
    MOV      $01        %acc       //20
    PUSH     %acc
    PUSH     2                     //n=2 args
    ENVGET   [g$00]                //#<procedure>
    CALL     %acc
    HALT
```
```
    +----------------------------+
    |             %ip            | <= SP
    +----------------------------+
    |             %ep            |
    +----------------------------+
    |             n=2            |
    +----------------------------+
    |             20             |
    +----------------------------+
    |             10             |
    +----------------------------+
```

The lambda function itself will immediately execute the ENTER instruction to
finish setting up the stack. The ENTER instruction pushes the previous frame's
BP on the stack and points BP to the last argument in the current call frame.

BP will be used by the procedure to access arguments on the stack.

```
ENTER
MOV      [%bp[-1]]  %acc
PUSH     %acc
MOV      [%bp[+0]]  %acc
ADD
RET
```
    +----------------------------+
    |             %bp            | <= SP
    +----------------------------+
    |             %ip            |
    +----------------------------+
    |             %ep            |
    +----------------------------+
    |             n=2            |
    +----------------------------+
    |             20             | <= SP
    +----------------------------+
    |             10             |
    +----------------------------+

The RET instruction restores the caller's stack given the %bp, %ip and %ep saved on the stack.
